Results of Lab 1:
Experiment Protocols:
*	PP1 Analysis:
*	Conclusion on Fairness: We got a 6 on the first roll, dice judged to be not fair per PP1.
*	Probability Analysis:
*	If the Dice were Fair: 1/6 probability it would be judged to be unfair.
*	If the Dice were unfair: It would depend on the level of modification that the 
unfair dice underwent, furthermore a fair dice would be judged to be fair 5/6.
*	PP2 Analysis:
*	Conclusion on Fairness:
*	Decision Rule: Dice is 6, 5 or more times and the dice is unfair. 
*	My results: Rolled a 6, 9 times-Dice is Unfair.
*	Class Results: Rolled a 6, 3 times-Dice is Fair.
*	Probability Analysis:
*	If dice is rolled 20 times, likely number 6 results is 16.67% of the rolls or 3.33 
times. Due to the law of large numbers:
*	Not unusual to get 1 more or less than that.
*	Not unusual to get 2 more or less than that.
*	Not unusual to get 3 more or less than that. 
*	If the dice were fair, the chance it could be judged unfair is 16.67%.
*	PP3 Analysis:
*	Conclusion on Fairness:
*	Decision Rule: Dice is a 6, 19 or more times and the dice is unfair. 
*	Class Results: Rolled a 6, 17 times, so dice is Fair.
*	Probability Analysis:
*	It is fair to say that every conclusion has some confidence level attached.
*	Boundaries should be set where the results fall out of an expected range of 
outcomes.
*	If the dice were fair, the chance it could be judged unfair is 16.67%. 
*	EP1 (Our Experiment Protocol):
*	Chosen Protocol: For our Protocol we rolled the dice 50 more times to add to PP3 for a 
total of 150 rolls. The decision rule was if dice was a 6, 27 or more times it was judged to 
be unfair.
*	Conclusion on Fairness:
*	Class Results: Rolled a 6, 24 times therefore dice ruled to be fair.
*	Conclusion: I would revise the experiment to be a range of outcomes instead of a set 
number of times a 6 would be rolled. This will consider the dice being modified for 
another number or numbers to be rolled disproportionately other than the number 6. I 
feel this would be a better way to judge fair dice.
